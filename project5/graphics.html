    <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
    <p>
        I have always been a creator, but it all started with a passion for drawing. Over the years I
        started to experiment with different mediums. Iâ€™d always thought of art as a hobby, it had never crossed my mind to persue it as a career.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my junior year of high school, I decided to explore yet another way to be creative and display
        my art. I joined the Graphic Design and Creative Media CRTC (Concord Regional Technical Center) at my high school. Here, I was introduced to digital art and design. This opened so many new doors for my creativity and raised my interest of combining technology and art as a future career. By the end of my senior year, I was ble to get certified in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe InDesign.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is because of this program that I decided to pursue a double major in Graphic Design and
        Information Management Technology at Syracuse University, with concentrations in web development and project management. I am excited to continue my studies at SU and gain new skills while flourishing as an individual.
