        Maria Fernanda Ruelas Arceo

        I am a dual major in graphic design and information management interested in UX/UI for video games and apps. 
        
        Skills:
        
        Certified in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign
        Fluent in Spanish
        CPR Certified
        
        Outside of work, I love to play guitar and ukulele. I enjoy art and like to experiment with different art forms and mediums. I am very passionate about working out and trying new sports such as field hockey, boxing, and weightlifting. My favorite book author is Sarah J. Maas, with her Throne of Glass series being my favorite. 
        
        My family moved from Mexico City in 2016 and I have lived in New Hampshire since then. I have a younger brother and no pets. I have a habit of sleeping in until around noon time and always falling asleep during car rides.
