                Whenever I am making a portrait I ask myself, what am I trying to communicate with this image? And how
                would
                I
                want to be photographed? It is important to immerse yourself in the environment of the people you are
                photographing to understand who they are and what they stand for. This way, you can communicate their
                personality and essence through the images you make.

            <h1>The Harrington</h1>
            <p>
                One of my biggest interests and hobbies is music. Whether I’m playing my guitar, listening to it on my
                headphones, or photographing it live. Music fuels my everyday life and accompanies me everywhere I go.
                As I
                enter deeper into the world of photography, it has been an honor to take pictures of bands and music
                venues.
                There is nothing like capturing the moments of a great performance.
            </p>

            <h1>Stuck In A Daydream</h1>
            <p>
                Dreams have always been facinating to me. For this collection of photographs I wanted to achieve a
                surreal,
                angelic, and dreamy effect by playing around with in-camera filters. In order to achieve this look I
                took a
                crafty approach and made my own camera filter. This process taught me that you can get really
                interesting
                camera
                effects without spending a single penny.

            <p>
                I love waiting to capture just the right moment. It is important for me to capture the authenticity of
                the
                people I photograph. No matter how many pictures I have to take, being patient and on the lookout for
                that
                key
                moment is worth it. Taking candid pictures of people is probably one of my favorite types of photography
                and
                I
                always love the results.

                Its incredible to see the different ways in which you can use your camera to create beautiful and unique

                around
                with different light colors and camera movements to get the results I was looking for.

            <h1>Motion Blur</h1>
            <p>
                Every day I try to experiment with my photography. I find long shutter speeds to be really fun to play
                with.
                I
                believe that the blurriness and motion provide a different mood to portraits and it can be a great tool
                for
                storytelling. Often it’s very hard to duplicate the same motion more than once, which makes these
                photographs
                even more special and unique.
